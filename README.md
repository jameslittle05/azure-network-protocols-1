<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

- ### [YouTube: Azure Virtual Machines, Wireshark, and Network Security Groups](https://www.youtube.com)

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Create Resource Groups
- Observe ICMP Traffic
- Observe SSH Traffic
- Observe DHCP Traffic
- Observe RDP Traffic

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
Resource Groups, similar to a file system, are logical collections of virtual machines, storage accounts, virtual networks, web apps, databases, and/or database servers. Virtual Machines (VM) make it easier to scale your applications by adding more physical or virtual servers, distributing the workload across multiple VMs. We created two Virtual Machines (pictured below) with different Operating Systems (Windows 10 21H2 & Linux Ubuntu Server 20.04) to be used for Remote Desktop and to observe network traffic between the two devices.

Next, we connected to the Remote Desktop. Remote desktop enables users to connect to a computer in another location, view its desktop, and interact with it as if it were local. By performing a quick search for "remote desktop connection," users can access the VM. In this instance, we will enter the public IP address details for VM1 (Windows 10 21H2) to install Wireshark (packet analysis software) instead of using our local machine. (Below is a pictured search for remote desktop and the result for entering the IP address.)
